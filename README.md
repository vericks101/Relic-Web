# Ekodex-Web
A repository to represent the website front on Ekodex, a single platform for game projects that I've created and are applicable to a single gaming platform model.

Check out the live hosted application here: https://ekodex.netlify.app/

Check out the back-end server repository here: https://github.com/vericks101/Ekodex-RESTAPI

## Local Setup and Configuration
Ensure `node_modules` is available else the application will fail to run. If needed, run `npm install` to pull the needed dependencies.

Once the above is followed, run `npm start` to locally start up the website application.
